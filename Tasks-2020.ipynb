    "### Introduction\n",
    "Firstly in order to begin this task we need the understand what we mean by a list and dictonary are in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List and Dictonaries\n",
    "According to Lisa Tagliaferri<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> a list is data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a list is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    list_example = [ \"shark\", \"cuttlefish\", \"squid\", \"anemone\" ]\n",
    "\n",
    "While w3schools.com<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> defines a dictionary as a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a dictionary is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    dictionary_example = { 11, \"tom\", \"Sean\",  2.4, \"Seven\", 2014 }\n",
    "    \n",
    "Dictionaries and lists share many of the same characteristics inlcuding:\n",
    "   * Both are mutable.\n",
    "   * Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.\n",
    "   * Both can be nested. A list can contain another list. A dictionary can contain another dictionary. A dictionary can also contain a list, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "However they differ in how elements are accessed:\n",
    "* List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.\n",
    "* Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This different can been seen in the example below where the function list[1] will return the second element in the list while the function dictionary[1] will search for the key value 1 and return the corresponding value.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>"
