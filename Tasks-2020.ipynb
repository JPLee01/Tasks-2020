    "### Introduction\n",
    "Firstly in order to begin this task we need the understand what we mean by a list and dictionary are in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List and Dictionaries\n",
    "According to Lisa Tagliaferri<sup>[1]</sup> a list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a list is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    list_example = [ \"shark\", \"cuttlefish\", \"squid\", \"anemone\" ]\n",
    "\n",
    "While w3schools.com<sup>[2]</sup> defines a dictionary as a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a dictionary is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    dictionary_example = { 11, \"tom\", \"Sean\",  2.4, \"Seven\", 2014 }\n",
    "    \n",
    "Dictionaries and lists share many of the same characteristics including:\n",
    "   * Both are mutable.\n",
    "   * Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.\n",
    "   * Both can be nested. A list can contain another list. A dictionary can contain another dictionary. A dictionary can also contain a list and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "However they differ in how elements are accessed:\n",
    "* List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.\n",
    "* Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference can been seen in the example below where the function list[1] will return the second element in the list while the function dictionary[1] will search for the key value 1 and return the corresponding value.<sup>[3]</sup>"

    "From a reivew of the literature available on the simulation of flipping a coin it appears that the use of the binomial distribution function is not that frequent. The work of Data8<sup>[18]</sup> uses the random.choice function, while Rafael Knuth<sup>[19]</sup> uses the random.randint function used in the previous task. Gauri Shanker<sup>[20]</sup> in his calculation appreas to attach letters to the coin faces and use to random function.The programming forums Codecademy<sup>[21]</sup> and Stack Overflow<sup>[22]</sup> advocate the use of the random.randrange and random.randint functions respectively. While Datacamp<sup>[23]</sup> teaches it's students to use the bernoulli.rvs() function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distinct lack of the use of the binomial distribution function is quiet strange, as by definition, the binomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the outcome of *n* independent trials in an experiment. Each trial is assumed to have only two outcomes, either success or failure and have a probability associated with success and failure.<sup>[24]</sup>  \n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution fuction by its nature, would be a very good function to use to simulate a coin flip as the user is able to input the number of trials (*n*) as well as set the success (Heads) or failure (tails) of the experiment. The porbability can also be set to allow for the coin flip to be fair (.5), biased (>.5) or unbiased (<.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the review of the literature does predominantly point away from the use of the binomial distribution fuction. It should be noted that the works of Cmdline<sup>[25]</sup>, ReginaOfTech<sup>[26]</sup>, Tony Yiu<sup>[27]</sup>, and Tharaka Umayanga<sup>[28]</sup> do contain elements of the binomial distribution fuction and are used as inspiration of the below code."

    "## Task 4 - Simpson’s Paradox\n",
    "Simpson’s paradox is a well-known statistical paradox where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined into one big data set. Use numpy to create four data sets, each with an ```x``` array and a corresponding ```y``` array, to demonstrate Simpson’s paradox. You might create your ```x``` arrays using ```numpy.linspace``` and create the ```y``` array for each ```x``` using notation like ```y = a * x + b``` where you choose the ```a``` and ```b``` for each ```x``` , ```y``` pair to demonstrate the paradox."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Research\n",
    "According to Koswara et al., Simpson's paradox is a statistical phenomenon which occurs when \"some groups of data show a certain relationship in each group, but when the data is combined, that relationship is reversed\".<sup>[31]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Named after British statistician Edward Simpson and mentioned in his technical paper in 1951, Simpson's paradox has been found to be present across a broad range of spectrums including graduate admissions, baseball batting averafes and the US median wage.<sup>[32]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a very simple example of Simpson's paradox:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"centre\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" img src=\"https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/my_favorite_paradox/assets/img/03.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the above when you and a friend each take a set of exams your friend answers a higher proportion correctly than you on each of two days. However when the two days are combined you see that you have in fact answered a higher proportion correctly and won the challenge. This is Simpson's Paradox at its simpliest and it's identification and understanding can be vital.<sup>[33]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "While in the above simple example a misreading of the data would result in the wrong person being declared the champion, for other more serious cases it can have devastating effects. This can be seen in the study by Taylor and Mickel in which a claim of discrimination based on ethnicity was made through misinterpretation of the data.<sup>[34]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to overcomming Simpson's paradox according to Ameringer et al. is to focus: \"first identifying potential confounding variables during the planning phase of a study, and then controlling for these variables in both the design and analysis\" while also rembering that the goal of the study is: \"is to determine the true relationship between the independent and outcome variables\".<sup>[35]</sup> Skrivanek also highlights to overcome Simpson's paradox it is \"important to involve a cross‐functional team and especially subject matter experts and practitioners in the initial planning and selection of the variables to be measured.\"<sup>[36]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted Tom Grigg makes an interesting argument in his article when he states that in the identifying and controling of the variables stage in the study, the author: \"must then decide whether to break the data into separate distributions, or to keep the data combined. The correct decision is entirely situational and this is part of the reason why data science exists at the intersection of mathematics/statistics, computer science and business/domain knowledge: We need to know our data, and more importantly, what we want out of our data, in order to choose which approach to take\". While further explaining in the article: \"the key is to interpret the data in relation to the underlying domain, and to take the most appropriate data-viewpoint.\"<sup>[37]</sup>\n",

    "When the results are placed in graphical form we can see that depending on which graph you view you arrive at a different conclusion. From the first graph (Admissions Precentage in Subject Department by Gender) the determination could me made that a large amount of females are admitted to the departments versus thier male counterparts, and an argument could be made that gender discrimination against males is present. However, when you take the level of admissions as a percentage of total admissions into account the conclusion could be drawn that the level of admissions are quiet similiar for male and females apart from the English department which could be put down to an outlier. When the average admissions across the Departments is calculated as percentage we see in fact it appears males have a greater chance of being admitted than females, debunking the previous conclusion from the first graph. \n",

    "These three graphs highlight Simpson's Paradox and raises the question of which data should we consulted in forming  a decision. The key for data analysts is to acknowledge the exisitance of Simpson's Paradox and ensure that it's at the forefront of their minds when conducting analysis. Correct segmenting of your data by important factors will also reduce the chance of Simpson's Paradox greatly.<sup>[41]</sup>  However, an element of common sense must also prevail. As Harsh Patel says: \"If something smells fishy — look into it. Do not trust your data blindly.\"<sup>[42]</sup>"
