Jupyter Notebook created to store and highlight the four tasks for the Tasks 2020 Assessment for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Subject.

## Task 1 - Counts
Requirment is to write a Python function called Counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. Caveat is that the code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise.
